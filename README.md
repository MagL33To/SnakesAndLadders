# Snakes and ladders

To run this app, please clone the repository down to your local machine and build it (making sure you have nuget auto package download turned on). There is no main program calling the game logic, so please check functionality through tests or add one.

Given more time, I would add a front end to call the game logic, handle end-game scenarios better and add more tests. I didn't add a specific BoardTests class because I felt the other tests cover the current functionality within the Board class.
